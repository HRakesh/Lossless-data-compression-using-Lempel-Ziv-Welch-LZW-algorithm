# Lossless-data-compression-using-Lempel-Ziv-Welch-LZW-algorithm
The Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. LZW is an adaptive compression algorithm that does not assume prior knowledge of the input data distribution. This algorithm works well when the input data is sufficiently large and there is redundancy in the data
